# Data Professional Survey Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes survey responses from data professionals using Power BI to understand
career roles, salary trends, programming language preferences, geographic distribution, and
job satisfaction metrics.

The dataset contains responses from approximately 630 participants and was transformed and
modeled to create a clean, interactive dashboard for business intelligence insights.

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI
- Power Query
- DAX 

## Data Source
- Public Data Professional Survey dataset

## Data Cleaning & Transformation
The following transformations were performed using Power Query:
- Removed empty and irrelevant columns
- Standardized free-text fields by grouping low-frequency values into an "Others" category
  (Job Title, Favorite Programming Language, Country, Industry)
- Cleaned and transformed salary range data to calculate average salary metrics
- Validated data consistency before building the dashboard

## Analysis Performed
The dashboard includes analysis of:
- Average salary by job title
- Favorite programming languages across roles
- Country-wise distribution of survey respondents
- Work-life balance satisfaction
- Salary satisfaction
- Perceived difficulty of breaking into data-related roles
- Average age of survey participants

## Dashboard Output
An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to allow users to explore trends across job roles,
skills, geography, and satisfaction metrics.

## Key Insight
The analysis highlights noticeable differences in average salary across data roles, with Python
emerging as the most commonly used programming language, and many respondents indicating that
breaking into data roles is perceived as difficult.

## Outcome
This project demonstrates end-to-end Power BI skills, including data cleaning, transformation,
basic modeling, and dashboard design to deliver actionable workforce insights.
