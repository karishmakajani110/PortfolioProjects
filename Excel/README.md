# Bike Sales Dashboard using Excel

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing bike sales data using Microsoft Excel
to understand customer purchasing behavior and demographic trends.

The goal was to prepare raw data, perform analysis using pivot tables, and build an interactive
dashboard to support business insights.

## Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Nested IF Statements

## Data Source
- Sample bike sales dataset used for analysis and dashboard development

## Data Cleaning & Transformation
The following data preparation steps were performed in Excel:
- Removed duplicate records to ensure data accuracy
- Standardized gender values (M -> Male, F -> Female)
- Standardized marital status values (M -> Married, S -> Single)
- Created a custom Age Bracket column using nested IF statements
- Validated data consistency before analysis

## Analysis Performed
Using pivot tables, the following analyses were conducted:
- Average income per bike purchase by gender
- Bike purchases by age bracket
- Bike purchases by commute distance
- Purchase behavior by marital status, education level, and region

## Dashboard Output
An interactive Excel dashboard was created to visualize key metrics and trends.

## Key Insight
The analysis showed that middle-aged customers and higher-income groups were more likely to
purchase bikes, with commute distance also influencing purchasing behavior.

## Outcome
This project demonstrates Excel-based data cleaning, transformation, and analytical skills,
as well as the ability to convert raw data into a business-focused dashboard.
